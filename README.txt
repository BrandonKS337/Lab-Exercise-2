Absolutely FANTASTIC template and it is set up for free usage by entry level novices like my
myself to take advantage of and gain inspiration off of.

AMAZING transitions between different medias to show it operating on various device types and an overall
simple layout that is as easy to understand and navigate as it is easy on the eyes.

Keeping the credits listed in the read me because the original art and design elements really deserve the acknowledgment.
