          As a fresh face in the community I have a ton of ideas to mold, modify, and perfect into fully functional
          applications. I personally believe that when designing an app the usefullness of its content is right there at
          the top of the priorities list next to the functional consistency and the overall aesthetic. With that in mind
          each of my ideas will be hyper focused around optimizing the project's ability to assist and satisfy the needs
          and desires of any user who took the time to give my work their attention. Here are a few of my project
          concepts that you can look forward to seeing for yourself in the future firsthand from the comfort of your own
          device.

                  Chore list examples or a randomizer could also be exceptionally usefull.</h3>

                  coded well</h3>

                  deciding a food plan this will help.
                  The idea is a normal digital cook book but it will include a random meal picker function for either
                  single day/week/month options. I myself am super lazy
                  with cooking so this personally would help me plan and prepare food especially if it includes an "add
                  ingredients to shopping list" button

                  This is a fitness app. Yes I know you're thinking "ugh another one?? lame," the nice thing is this one
                  is designed with the busy body in mind. Lil Baby steps is intended to include a fitness tracker,
                  random WoD that can be set for a single day/week/month at a time
                  and will potentially include exercise demonstration for those of us who have had no time to keep up
                  with workout lingo. More for getting new gym bodies into the flow of things
                  but will be targeting hardcore gym rats as well with its workout tracker functions.</h3>

                  pulling from archives and data bases to present statistical data of NPCs and monsters. Will also
                  include combat tracker and character sheets creation. biggest thing that would set it aside
                  is a built in sound/ambient noise section that can import tracks to a device for quick DM changes to

          and full-time (plus some) dad of 2 who never stops absorbing anything and everything around him to improve
          himself. I have been in a myriad of other careers/jobs and am now finally starting to follow a passion for
          coding
          and development that I know will lead to amazing things in the future. I earned my Bachelors degree from the
          University of Louisiana Lafayette in 2014 and have now returned to further my scope of knowledge with ULL and
          the Institute of Data. I have an extremely easy going attitude and a fierce persistance to succeed even at
          menial tasks which has never failed me so far. I am driven to find a long term career in coding
          that will both help further my personal goals as well as lead me to developing things that generally will help
          others further theirs in some way aswell.
          My belief is that technology if done right can help even those stubborn enough to ignore it. So why not put
          things out there that are able to speak for themselves
          to such a point that even the non-believers in digital mediums will be drawn to dive into the content we as
          developers provide. </p>
